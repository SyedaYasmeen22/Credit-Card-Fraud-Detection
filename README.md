The code in this repository is taken entirely from the following book:

“[Machine Learning Foundations Voume 1: Supervised Learning]” by [Roi Yehoshuda]

I have not modified or extended the original code.
The purpose of uploading this notebook is to practice running machine learning workflows, understand how fraud detection models work, and learn how to use GitHub for project sharing.

All credit for the code belongs to the original author.
This repository is only for educational and learning purposes.
